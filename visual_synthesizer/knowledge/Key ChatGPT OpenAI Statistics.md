## ChatGPT History

ChatGPT was trained on a massive amount of data to function. OpenAI claims that they've fed the tool with 300 billion words from websites, books, articles, and posts.

According to a [tweet by Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353?lang=en), CEO of OpenAI, ChatGPT gained **one million users** in the first five days of its launch.

In just two months after launch, the monthly active users of ChatGPT crossed **100 million** — making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

**Note:** The ChatGPT record was broken by the Instagram Threads app, which crossed one million users in only 1 hour and 100 million in two days.

Witnessing the fastest adoption of ChatGPT among the masses, [UBS analysts reported](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), **'In 20 years following the Internet space, we cannot recall a faster ramp in a consumer Internet app.'**

To put that into perspective, TikTok took nine months, and Instagram took two and a half years to reach 100 million users — something that ChatGPT did in a mere two months. The diagram compares the [time taken to reach 1 million users](https://www.statista.com/chart/29174/time-to-one-million-users/) by the top online services.

## ChatGPT Users

In order to get an appropriate response from ChatGPT, all you need is a clear prompt with sufficient details. Here are a few **ChatGPT statistics** that reveal the user growth, demographics, age, and more:

**1. The ChatGPT website sees over 1.5 billion in September 2023**

The latest available data by [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/website/chat.openai.com/#traffic) indicates that the ChatGPT website generated over 1.5 billion total visits in September 2023 — which is 4.69% higher than the previous month.

ChatGPT has a bounce rate of 36.36%. Each user spends around 7 minutes 36 minutes on the website and views 4.17 pages per visit.

**2. Nearly half of Americans have heard either a little or a lot about ChatGPT**

A recent [poll by YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/technology/articles/45128-what-americans-think-about-chatgpt-and-ai-text?redirect_from=%2Ftopics%2Ftechnology%2Farticles-reports%2F2023%2F02%2F01%2Fwhat-americans-think-about-chatgpt-and-ai-text) reveals that **nearly half of Americans** have heard a little or a lot about ChatGPT. Out of these, approximately two-thirds of people with a postgraduate degree.

The same report said that [54%](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/tabs_ChatGPT_20230124.pdf) of respondents have heard **'nothing at all'** about ChatGPT.

![How many people know about ChatGPT according to YouGov survey](https://www.notta.ai/pictures/chatgpt-statistics-02.png "chatgpt-statistics-02")

**3. 48% of respondents in a survey said they are not familiar with generative AI**

[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1368831/familiarity-with-social-media-in-the-united-states/) did a survey among United States citizens to see how familiar they are with the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in social media in 2023, and the results are out:

![ChatGPT users vary depending on the country](https://www.notta.ai/pictures/chatgpt-statistics-05.png "chatgpt-statistics-05")

**3. ChatGPT is available in nearly 161 countries around the globe**

While there are around [161 countries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries) where ChatGPT is available, some major countries still lack access to it. Here are some of them.

-   China
    
-   Russia
    
-   Ukraine (certain exceptions)
    
-   Iran
    
-   Belarus
    
-   Venezuela
    
-   Afghanistan
    

### #2 User Growth

ChatGPT isn't the perfect AI chatbot, but it can help users get a heap of ideas, brainstorm topics, prepare a quick first draft of an article, [transcribe audio](https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/can-chatgpt-transcribe-audio), and even [create YouTube summaries.](https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/youtube-summary-with-chatgpt)

For this reason, ChatGPT has a large user base — which has been growing dramatically since its launch. Here's a quick overview of ChatGPT user growth from November 2022 to September 2023.

-   In just 5 days of launch, ChatGPT crossed 1 million users.
    
-   By January 2023 (that is, two months after its launch), ChatGPT users grew by 9900% — which means it gained 100 million active users.
    
-   In April 2023, the estimated user traffic was 173 million users.
    

While ChatGPT saw a staggering 577% increase in website traffic from November 2022 to April 2023, the website saw a drop in monthly visits in the next three consecutive months.

-   ChatGPT's traffic fell from [1.8 billion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-traffic-slips-again-third-month-row-2023-09-07/) visits to 1.43 billion by the end of August 2023.
    
-   Similarly, the amount of time visitors spend on the website seems to have declined since March 2023 — from an average of 8.7 minutes to 7 minutes in August.
    

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-traffic-slips-again-third-month-row-2023-09-07/) reported that school coming back to session in September may help raise ChatGPT's traffic and usage — and that's what happened. In September 2023, the total visits bounced back to [1.5 billion](https://www.similarweb.com/website/chat.openai.com/#traffic) — which equals an increase of 4.69% compared to the previous month.

### #3 ChatGPT App Statistics

Witnessing the popularity of ChatGPT, OpenAI released Android and iOS apps.

1. On May 18, 2023, OpenAI launched the [ChatGPT app for iOS](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios), which is free to use and syncs your history well across devices.

2. The iOS version of the ChatGPT app reached [5 million downloads](https://www.data.ai/en/insights/top-trending-apps/chat-gpt-mobile-debut/) in only three weeks of its launch.

3. The US is the largest market for ChatGPT, with nearly [1.5 million](https://www.data.ai/en/insights/top-trending-apps/chat-gpt-mobile-debut/) iOS downloads.

4. A [survey by Savanta](https://savanta.com/knowledge-centre/view/chatgpt-how-are-consumers-using-it-and-what-issues-do-they-face/#:~:text=Savanta%20surveyed%20over,and%20above)%20(20%25).) reveals that 47% of respondents have used ChatGPT for fun or learning purposes. Surprisingly, 42% of millennials use it for businesses, which is higher than 29% of Gen Z users, 26% of Gen X, and 20% of Boomers.

5. ChatGPT app users vary depending on the region.

## ChatGPT Updates

ChatGPT uses GPT language models to answer user queries, but it's far from a perfect and accurate AI tool. This is why OpenAI constantly tries to improve ChatGPT and make it better and, of course, accurate. Here are some **ChatGPT statistics** about the [recent updates](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes):

1. With the browse rollout, ChatGPT can now fetch the information from the Internet to provide current and authoritative information — though the update is only available to Plus users.

2. OpenAI is rolling out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT to offer a new, intuitive interface type. While the voice feature will be available to Android and iOS Plus users, the image input can be accessed on paid plans and on all platforms.

3. ChatGPT now supports multiple languages like Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish — though the feature is still in alpha.

4. On August 28, 2023, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Enterprise to offer enterprise-grade security and privacy, longer context windows, higher-speed **GPT-4** access, customization options, and advanced data analysis capabilities.

5. On May 12, 2023, OpenAI implemented initial support for plugins to help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, use third-party services, and run computations. Some [plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) available are Expedia, KAYAK, Shopify, OpenTable, Slack, Speak, and Zapier.

6. OpenAI's ChatGPT updated its model to improve accuracy and factuality. According to the January 9, 2023 [update](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes), OpenAI has made improvements to the ChatGPT model to generate better responses on a wide range of topics.

## GPT-4 Statistics

While both ChatGPT and GPT-4 were built by the same research company — OpenAI, there's a key difference:

ChatGPT is a powerful AI chatbot that uses GPT (a large language model) to interact with humans. The free version relies on 20 billion of GPT-3's parameters, which eventually helps in producing convincing textual responses. In order to stop ChatGPT from going off the rails, OpenAI has also introduced content filters.

GPT-4 is a large language model trained on terabytes of Internet data that allows the artificial intelligence model to generate text. It is one of the largest neural networks — modeled after the human brain — that allows GPT-4 to take an input and give output that best matches the request.

1. [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), released on March 14, 2023, can chat, hear, and speak — bringing new capabilities like video processing, quicker responses, and multimodality.

2. OpenAI's GPT-4 model is available only to ChatGPT Plus subscribers.

3. Contrary to ChatGPT, the advanced version — GPT-4 — can handle text and images as input and output.

4. Like ChatGPT, the data of GPT-4 cuts off in [September 2021](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

5. GPT-4 is the largest language model with [1 trillion parameters](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai#:~:text=The%20latest%20language%20model%2C%20GPT%2D4%2C%20has%201%20trillion%20parameters.) — though there are new speculations that the number is closer to 220 billion.

6. OpenAI claims that GPT-4 scores [40%](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) higher than GPT-3 (another large language model by OpenAI).

7. In an OpenAI analysis, GPT-4 performed better than GPT-3 and other older models across many categories like mathematics, technology, writing, science, recommendation, business, code, and learning.

8. According to OpenAI's report, GPT-4 responses were preferred over the answers of GPT -3.5 on [70.2%](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) of prompts.

9. Out of 26 languages tested, GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of GPT-3.5 and some low-resource languages like Welsh, Latvian, and Swahili.

10. OpenAI decreased GPT-4 tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content by 82%.

11. GPT-4 has a higher chance of up to 29% to respond to sensitive requests.

12. GPT-4 outperforms other versions in professional tests and exams.

13. GPT-4 scored 90% in the Uniform Bar Exam and 99% in the GRE Verbal section. This graph illustrates the performance of GPT-4, GPT-4 (no vision) and GPT-3.5.

## OpenAI Statistics

OpenAI is the company behind one of the most interesting and popular [AI tools](https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/ai-tools) — ChatGPT. As of January 2023, OpenAI has a funding of over [1 billion US dollars](https://www.statista.com/topics/10406/openai/#topicOverview) and ranks among the most funded machine learning startup companies in the world.

**1. OpenAI is one of the most expensive AI startups**

In 2021, OpenAI's startup valuation was around [$260 million](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/ai-powered-media-editing-app-descript-lands-fresh-cash-from-openai/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20report%20from,January%202021%20(%24260%20million)). Reportedly, OpenAI seeks a roughly [$80 to $90 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-seeks-new-valuation-of-up-to-90-billion-in-sale-of-existing-shares-ed6229e0) valuation — which makes the AI startup more expensive by publicly traded AI platforms like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet.

**2. OpenAI's revenue has fallen drastically from 2018 to 2021**

[OpenAI's revenue](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541) was around $13,807,074 in 2016 and crossed $49,968,631 in 2018. However, the revenue fell to $11,728 in 2021 — indicating a huge gap.

-   2016: $13,807,074
    
-   2017: $33,228,665
    
-   2018: $49,968,631
    
-   2019: $31,932,729
    
-   2020: $3,481,784
    
-   2021: $11,728
    

![OpenAI's revenue has fallen drastically from 2018 to 2021](https://www.notta.ai/pictures/chatgpt-statistics-07.png "chatgpt-statistics-07")

**3. The net income of OpenAI was around $1,377,836 in 2021.**

[OpenAI's profit](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541) graph is a bit zig zag — the company saw its best days in 2019 (when the profit was $28,599,812). Soon, the profit curve saw a decline in 2021, with a net income of - $1,377,836.

-   2016: $2,569,398
    
-   2017: $4,560,437
    
-   2018: - $1,580,378
    
-   2019: $28,599,812
    
-   2020: - $9,508,759
    
-   2021: - $1,377,836
    

![OpenAI's profit graph from 2016 to 2021](https://www.notta.ai/pictures/chatgpt-statistics-08.png "chatgpt-statistics-08")

4. In September 2023, OpenAI discontinued the waitlist for the DALL.E image generator, allowing users to sign up for the advanced version — DALL.E 2.

5. DALL.E 2 boasts an active user base of over [1.5 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/10/21/dalle-mini-and-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-art/?sh=1f92e6e87d78#:~:text=The%20waitlist%20for%20the%20DALL%C2%B7E%20image%20generator%20was%20eliminated%20in%20September%2C%20and%20everyone%20could%20sign%20up%20for%20the%20new%20version%2C%20DALL%C2%B7E%202.%20DALL%C2%B7E%202%20was%20rebranded%20to%20the%20original%20term%2C%20and%20over%201.5%20million%20users%20now%20generate%20about%20two%20million%20images%20per%20day%20using%20the%20tool.) individuals, with user professions spanning many creative professions like authors, architects, and directors.

6. Users generate about [2 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/10/21/dalle-mini-and-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-art/?sh=1f92e6e87d78#:~:text=The%20waitlist%20for%20the%20DALL%C2%B7E%20image%20generator%20was%20eliminated%20in%20September%2C%20and%20everyone%20could%20sign%20up%20for%20the%20new%20version%2C%20DALL%C2%B7E%202.%20DALL%C2%B7E%202%20was%20rebranded%20to%20the%20original%20term%2C%20and%20over%201.5%20million%20users%20now%20generate%20about%20two%20million%20images%20per%20day%20using%20the%20tool.) images every day using OpenAI's DALL.E 2.

7. OpenAI has a relatively small team with just [375 employees](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-is-making-headlines-its-also-seeding-talent-across-silicon-valley) (full-time), but its influence is notable in Silicon Valley — all thanks to ChatGPT.

8. Microsoft extended its partnership with OpenAI by facilitating cloud services for OpenAI products and funding of [$10 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html).

9. With big companies boosting AI spending, OpenAI is currently on pace to generate over [$1 billion in revenue](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending) — which is much more than the $28 million revenue reported last year.

10. The company OpenAI has projected [$200 million](https://www.reuters.com/technology/booming-traffic-openais-chatgpt-posts-first-ever-monthly-dip-june-similarweb-2023-07-05/) in revenue in 2023.

11. According to [SimilarWeb's](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/) September 2023, OpenAI ranks 22 among the top websites.

## Challenges Faced by ChatGPT

ChatGPT is still a fairly new AI chatbot, so there are a couple of things you'll need to keep in mind when using it. In this section, I'll walk you through some challenges faced by ChatGPT in the past.

**1. ChatGPT generates wrong answers.**

ChatGPT fails at basic maths calculations — and cannot even answer simple logic questions. Shockingly, the AI chatbot goes as far as arguing for completely incorrect facts.

OpenAI very well understands this limitation of ChatGPT and [writes](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) — 'ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.'

In short, ChatGPT hallucinates often, which makes it dangerous, especially for those seeking medical advice.

**2. ChatGPT is challenging education.**

Using the GPT language models, ChatGPT can perform — or at least try to perform — many tasks like answering questions, writing copy, drafting emails, explaining code in different programming languages, and more. It can even proofread writing or give suggestions about how to improve certain paragraphs.

Everyone has experimented with ChatGPT in one way or another, and teachers are no different. They have fed English assignments to ChatGPT — and the results were shocking. The AI chatbot generated better answers than many students could do — and that, too, without hesitation.

Unsurprisingly, educators and students are experimenting with AI to see how the AI chatbot can help them. [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/01/22/scores-of-stanford-students-used-chatgpt-on-final-exams-survey-suggests/) surveyed around 4497 respondents to see how many students use ChatGPT for assignments and exams. Here's what the students said:

-   17% of respondents said they used ChatGPT during their fall quarter assignments and exams.
    
-   Out of those 17%, here is what the students have to say:
    
    -   59.2% of students said they used AI mainly for brainstorming, forming ideas, and outlining.
        
    -   29.1% agreed that they answered multiple-choice questions using ChatGPT.
        
    -   7.3% said they submitted ChatGPT responses as answers but with some edits.
        
    -   5.5% claimed that they submitted answers directly from ChatGPT without edits.
        

![The Stanford Daily surveys students who use ChatGPT](https://www.notta.ai/pictures/chatgpt-statistics-09.png "chatgpt-statistics-09")

**3. 31.5% of students believed that using ChatGPT for more than just ideas is a violation of the academic Honor code.**

[The Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/01/22/scores-of-stanford-students-used-chatgpt-on-final-exams-survey-suggests/) conducted an informal [poll](https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/how-to-create-a-poll-in-zoom) to gather students' views on what should be considered a violation of the academic Honor code, and here are the results:

-   31.5% of respondents believe that using ChatGPT for more than just ideas should be a violation.
    
-   22.7% said using ChatGPT at all is a violation.
    
-   21% said violation means using ChatGPT responses as answers with no edits.
    
-   13% marked their response as no, whereas 12.7% were unsure.
